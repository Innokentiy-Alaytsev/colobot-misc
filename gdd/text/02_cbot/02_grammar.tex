\todo[inline]{Complete description}


\section{White Space}
White space are all the characters that are ignored by lexer during analysis. In CBot there are free white space characters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Space
    \item Tabulation
    \item New line
\end{itemize}


\section{Comments}
Comments are separated parts of the source code that are ignored by lexer during analysis. There are two types of comments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Line comments that start with \texttt{//} and end with new line
    \item Block comments that start with \texttt{/*} and end with \texttt{*/}
\end{itemize}

Example of valid comments are shown below.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=cbot]
// This is line comment.

/*
  This is block comment.
  Everything here is ignored.
*/
\end{lstlisting}
