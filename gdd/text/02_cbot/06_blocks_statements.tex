\section{Blocks}
A block is a statement that is used to group other statements together. Blocks are defined using curly braces \texttt{\{ \}}. All statements between \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}} are considered part of block. Statements within block are executed in order they appear in that block. Blocks can be put within other blocks as well.

In order to keep code clean and readable, instructions within block are usually indented.
