\chapter{General Information}

CBot is a programming language created and used internally by Colobot and CeeBot games. It was designed by EPSITEC and it's syntax is based on syntax of known programming languages, such as C++ and Java.

CBot is an interpreted, statically typed programming language. It has basic class support and thread synchronization.

This chapter is meant to provide a specification that will unambiguously describe all language features and will allow us to refine CBot language interpreter implemented in EPSITEC games.

Chapter \ref{chap:cbot_grammar} describes the basics of grammar and lexical structure of CBot language. This description is very technical and is meant to be used by interpreter designers rather than robot programmers.

Chapter \ref{chap:cbot_types} contains a documentation of all CBot types, information about variables, and conversion between values.

Functions, their definition and structure is described in chapter \ref{chap:cbot_functions}.
