This little book is our effort and attempt into proper organization within the team. Ever since EPSITEC gave us the source code of Colobot game, not everything has been properly documented and understood. Many features are probably forgotten until someone comes across them. For this reason we decided to document as many features as possible.

Game design document is divided into two parts. First part is concerned only with the game ideas and implementation. It contains a description of basic game design, the genre, complete description of all objects within the game, main story and technical description of implementation details.

Second one is focused on CBot programming language. It serves a purpose of both language specification and language manual. It describes all features of the CBot language, including those that were not included in in-game CBot manual.
