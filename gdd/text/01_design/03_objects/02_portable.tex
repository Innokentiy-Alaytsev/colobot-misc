\subsection{Uranium Ore}

Uranium ore is essential to the production of nuclear power cells. It is to be found either on the ground, or in the subsoil. In the latter case, it needs to be first located and identified by a sniffer, then extracted using a derrick. The mark laid down by the sniffer, in case of positive identification of a deposit of uranium ore, is a yellow circle. A nuclear plant will then take care of converting the chunk into a new and fully charged nuclear power cell.

\subsection{Titanium}

Titanium is indispensable to the construction of buildings, bots and regular power cells. There is usually some left on the spaceship when you embark on a new mission. In case more is needed, you'll have to convert chunks of titanium ore into usable cubes of titanium.

\subsection{Power Cell}

A power cell supplies the bots and some buildings with energy. An entirely red power cell is empty. The green section describes the remaining capacity. A power cell can be recharged using a power station. A power plant is needed to produce a new and fully charged power cell. The capacity of a regular power cell is 10 times smaller than that of a nuclear power cell.

\subsection{Nuclear Cell}

A nuclear power cell supplies the bots and some buildings with energy. Its capacity is 10 times larger than that of a regular power cell. Nuclear power cells cannot be recharged. A nuclear plant is needed to produce a new and fully charged nuclear power cell.

\subsection{Organic Matter}

The organic matter is the insects' secretion. Wasps often store a supply of balls of organic matter. You should perhaps try to get hold of some since it could allow you, providing the necessary analysis, to uncover new and strange technologies. Anyway if you don't, they will most likely bombard you with them.

\subsection{Black Box}

A black box is actually orange so as to be easier to identify and locate. It is an essential part of a spaceship. Black boxes remaining from the first expedition provide essential data about what it achieved and where it headed after leaving the planet.

\subsection{Keys}

The keys give you access to the vault. You'll need 4 of them.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Key A, blue and triangle-shaped
    \item Key B, red and pentagon-shaped
    \item Key C, green and shaped as a 6-pointed star
    \item Key D, yellow and circular
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
