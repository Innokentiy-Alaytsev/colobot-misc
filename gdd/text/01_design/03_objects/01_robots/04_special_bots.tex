\subsubsection{Subber}

Amphibious tracked bot equipped with an operating claw. A subber is the only bot capable of moving and running operations underwater. It is best to check the power cell readings prior to immersion since replacing or re-charging it underwater is impossible. A subber can only pick up objects from the ground, as opposed to, for example, a battery from the back of another bot.

\subsubsection{Recycler}

Tracked bot designed to convert a derelict bot back into a reusable cube of titanium.

\subsubsection{Thumper}

Tracked bot designed to hit the ground with enormous force. The purpose of the thumping is to turn ants and spiders belly up within a radius of 100 meters. An insect on its back is not dead but will fight a desperate struggle to get right side up again. After an approximate 60 seconds of effort, it will usually succeed.

To visualize the zone of impact, hit the <range> button. Little red dots outline the circular zone for 20 seconds. The bot uses up a large amount of power. A thump will drain 2/5th of a regular power cell.

\subsubsection{Shielder}

Tracked bot designed to protect and defend against all enemy attacks within a perimeter of 12.5 meters. The individual shields of bots and buildings find themselves re-energized through the shielder's defensive actions.

A regular power cell allows for a 20-second activity span, much too short in most cases. A nuclear power cell is of course more suited to this bot.

\subsubsection{Phazer Shooter}

Tracked bot equipped with a very powerful phazer cannon.

This bot is the only one that is able to kill an Alien Queen. Also against all other aliens it is highly efficient. It has been developed by the first expedition and left behind in a vault. The fact that this canon can aim upward at an angle up to 45 degrees makes it also a powerful defense against wasps.
