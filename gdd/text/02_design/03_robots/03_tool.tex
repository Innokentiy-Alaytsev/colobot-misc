\section{Grabbers}

\todo[inline]{Fix style}
Bots equipped with an operating arm. Like all traditional bots, a grabber won't function underwater. What you'll need instead is a subber.


\section{Sniffers}

Bots equipped to prospect the geological structure of the subsoil. Like grabbers and shooters, sniffers exist with all four available chassis. Whenever it locates something of use, the sniffer lays down the following marks:

\begin{description}
    \item[a green cross] $\rightarrow$ energy deposit.
    \item[a red cross] $\rightarrow$ titanium ore.
    \item[a yellow circle] $\rightarrow$ uranium ore.
\end{description}


\section{Shooters}

Bots equipped with a fireball canon. The fireball canon is an attacking and defensive weapon against most kinds of enemies. Use it sparingly though for it requires large amounts of energy. A regular power cell will only allow you to shoot 4 fireball bursts.


\section{Orga shooters}

Bots equipped with an orgaball canon. The orgaball canon is more effective than the fireball canon. It shoots small spheres of corrosive organic matter. The analysis of some organic matter produced by aliens is necessary in order to perform the research for the plans of the orgaball canon. A regular power cell will allow you to shoot 11 orgaball bursts.
