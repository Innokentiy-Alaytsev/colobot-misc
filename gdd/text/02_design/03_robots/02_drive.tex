\section{Wheeled}

Wheels constitute a standard, fast and energy-saving mode of propulsion. It is perfectly adapted for a relatively flat terrain. Whenever the terrain gets sloped, it is advised to instead use a tracked, legged or, even better, a winged bot.


\section{Tracked}

Tracked bots will ascend steep inclinations but their movements will be considerably slowed down. A legged bot is sometimes preferred not only because it uses up half as much power but also because it is more suited to climb the steepest slopes. On flat ground, a wheeled bot constitutes a better option.


\section{Winged}

Spider-legged creeping bot. A moving legged grabber uses up half as much energy as a wheeled grabber. Additionally a legged bot is perfectly adapted to climb the steepest slopes.


\section{Legged}

Jet propelled flying bot. Winged bots can fly across natural obstacles such as mountains or lakes but their energy supply uses up quickly. They're slow on the ground. To cover a short distance that will not call for flying, it is recommended to instead use a wheeled bot. The display at the bottom of your screen indicates the temperature of the reactor. It should be kept in close check. If the reactor overheats, the engine stops and the bot crashes; \todo{Note about fall damage}this has got no serious consequence, except if you are flying over water, or over some alien: in both cases, the bot is lost.
