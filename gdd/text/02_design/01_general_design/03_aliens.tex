\section{Alien Ant}

Ants shoot tiny corrosive balls that in the end can quite successfully gnaw into the protective shielding of bots and buildings. Even your cosmonaut combination is only a week protection against their poison.

\section{Alien Worm}

Worms launch viruses at programmed bots\todo{and buildings?}.
The virus alters the programming to such an extent that the bot either functions in a very erratic way or stops functioning altogether.
Worms go about both on the surface and beneath. Going underground makes them undetectable and indestructible.

\section{Alien Spider}

Whenever a spider gets within a close enough range of its target, it inflates its abdomen and bursts into a multitude of tiny burning fragments. These fragments will smolder everything they get in contact with. Luckily the spider won't survive an action of this type.

\section{Alien Wasp}

The wasp is a formidable enemy, very hard to shoot down since its flying is particularly swift.
Wasps seek and store balls of organic matter that they will then hurl at your bots and buildings from above. The defense tower is pretty much the only way to be rid of them.

\section{Alien Queen}

This huge insect is the mother of them all. It lays eggs and from these eggs will hatch the various kinds of insects you're most likely to encounter:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ants
    \item spiders
    \item wasps
    \item worms
\end{itemize}
All of them are extremely hazardous to yourself and your mission.
Its protective shell is particularly resistant to firing.
