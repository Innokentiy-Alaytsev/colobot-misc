\section{Mine}

Mines should be left alone.
Mines were laid by the first expedition to defend against aliens. Because they caused so
many accidents, and following the pressure from the Congress and public opinion, your
expedition was not equipped with this technology.
They also appear in some programming exercises as a hard way to learn how to avoid obstacles. Mines
cannot be created or removed. They just happen to be there.
When working with a practice bot, don't get any closer than 2 meters.
